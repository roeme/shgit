Consider this a scratchpad for now. Subject to change.

* add repo state indicators (dirty/diffs/etc)
* decide on a strategy on how and when to load repository metadata
* make it easier to switch repos (and hence, reload per-repo settings)
* check for bash and/or git version, and document requirements

done (reference only)
---------------------
* make it possible to limit command completion to git commands only (we still honour

* use isolated history file
* make it possible to have silent initialization (configurable)
* make it possible to have the user define shell keywords (but only as far as it makes sense.)
* Set up git aliases like shell aliases
